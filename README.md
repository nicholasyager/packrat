PackRat
=======

An open-source PHP based document management solution.

## Installation

Curently there isn't an installation script. To have PackRat run correctly, create a MySQL database names "packrat", and populate it with 2 tables: "users", and "documents". Then configure the file "vars\mysql.conf" to include the correct hostname, username, and password for the database.

A proper installation script/page is in the works, so hang tight for that!

## Inception

PackRat was started in 2012 by [Nicholas Yager](http://www.nicholasyager.com) to help his dear mother deal with her ever-increasing piles of mail.
